# COUNTRIES APP

This is a final project of the course 'React Advanced'. It is an app where the users can explore the information about the countries in the world. Using this app, users can learn about the capital city, language, currency, population, weather etc of various countries. Homepage contains welcome message with some animation, Countries page contains the list of countries with their capital, language, currency, and population displayed in a card. When the card is clicked, it directs to another page where more information of that specific country can be seen. This app also contains authentication, therefore to know about countries the user first register to the app and need to login. On top of that, the users can add their favourite countries to the favourites page with a click.
